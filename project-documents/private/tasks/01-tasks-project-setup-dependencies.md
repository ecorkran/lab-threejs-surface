# Project Setup & Dependencies

## Verify Existing Dependencies

### Confirm Three.js Installation
- [x] **Verify Three.js is available**
  - [x] Check if Three.js is already installed in package.json
    1. Open `package.json` in the project root
    2. Look for `"three"` in the dependencies section
    3. Look for `"@types/three"` in devDependencies section
  - [x] If Three.js is missing, install it (skipped â€” already present)
    1. Run: `pnpm add three`
    2. Install TypeScript definitions: `pnpm add -D @types/three`
  - [x] Test Three.js import functionality
    1. Create temporary test file: `test-three.ts`
    2. Add import: `import * as THREE from 'three';`
    3. Add simple test: `console.log(THREE.REVISION);`
    4. Run TypeScript check: `pnpm ai-typecheck`
    5. Delete test file after verification
  - [x] Success: Three.js library available and properly typed without TypeScript errors

### Install Additional Dependencies (if needed)
- [x] **Check for missing React Three Fiber dependencies**
  - [x] Verify if R3F packages are needed for current phase
    1. Current phase uses vanilla Three.js only
    2. R3F installation deferred to future migration phase
  - [x] Document R3F packages for future reference
    1. `@react-three/fiber` - React renderer for Three.js

## AI Support Scripts Integration

### Add Required Build Scripts
- [x] **Locate AI support scripts template**

    1. Open `package.json` in project root
    2. Examine existing scripts section
    3. Identify any potential conflicts with new scripts
  - [x] Success: Scripts template located and existing scripts reviewed

- [x] **Merge AI support scripts with existing scripts**
  - [x] Add missing AI support scripts to package.json
    1. For each script in the template, check if it already exists
    2. If script exists with different content, keep the existing version
    3. Only add scripts that are completely missing
    4. Common scripts to verify:
       - `ai-typecheck` (TypeScript checking)
       - `ai-lint` (ESLint with fixes)
       - `ai-assisted-build` (Full build pipeline)
  - [x] Preserve existing script functionality
    1. Do not overwrite existing `build`, `dev`, `lint` scripts
    2. Keep existing guide setup scripts (`setup-guides`, etc.)
    3. Maintain existing formatting and development scripts
  - [x] Test script functionality
    1. Run `pnpm ai-typecheck` to verify TypeScript checking
    2. Run `pnpm ai-lint` to verify linting works
    3. Confirm no script conflicts or errors
  - [x] Success: AI support scripts integrated without breaking existing functionality

### Verify Project Build System
- [x] **Test complete build pipeline**
  - [x] Run TypeScript compilation check
    1. Execute: `pnpm ai-typecheck`
    2. Verify no TypeScript errors in existing codebase
    3. Fix any existing type issues if found
  - [x] Run linting process
    1. Execute: `pnpm ai-lint`
    2. Allow auto-fixes for minor formatting issues
    3. Address any remaining lint errors
  - [x] Run full build process
    1. Execute: `pnpm build`
    2. Verify successful Next.js production build
    3. Check for any build warnings or errors
    4. Confirm Three.js imports work in build process
  - [x] Success: Complete build pipeline working without errors

## Development Environment Verification

### Confirm IDE Integration
- [x] **Verify TypeScript support**
  - [x] Test Three.js type definitions in IDE
    1. Create temporary file with Three.js import
    2. Verify autocomplete works for THREE.* objects
    3. Confirm no red underlines or type errors
    4. Test intellisense for Three.js methods and properties
  - [x] Check project TypeScript configuration
    1. Verify `tsconfig.json` includes proper paths
    2. Confirm strict mode settings are appropriate
    3. Ensure Three.js types are properly resolved
  - [x] Success: Full TypeScript integration with Three.js support

### Project Structure Validation
- [x] **Confirm manta-templates structure**
  - [x] Verify existing component structure
    1. Check `src/components/cards/` directory exists
    2. Confirm `ThreeJSCard.tsx` is present and functional
    3. Verify `index.ts` export structure in cards directory
  - [x] Test existing Three.js card functionality
    1. Run development server: `pnpm dev`
    2. Navigate to page using ThreeJSCard
    3. Confirm 3D rendering works without errors
    4. Verify no console errors or warnings
  - [x] Success: Existing Three.js integration confirmed working

## Final Verification
