# Infinite 3D Cosine Terrain Generator

> A realtime 3D visualization that procedurally generates infinite rolling terrain using cosine-based mathematical functions, built with Three.js and Next.js.

---

## üåä What is this?
The Cosine Terrain Generator creates an infinite, animated 3D landscape in your browser using mathematical cosine functions. Unlike pre-recorded videos, every frame is calculated and rendered in realtime, creating smooth 120fps animations of rolling hills that extend infinitely in all directions. The terrain adapts dynamically to your device screen size.  Look for controls you can experiment with soon!

## üõ† How was it made?
This project was built using two powerful development tools:
- **[manta-templates](https://github.com/manta-digital/manta-templates)** - A modern Next.js template with Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Three.js support
- **[ai-project-guide](https://github.com/ecorkran/ai-project-guide)** - AI-assisted development methodology that guided the project architecture and implementation

The combination enabled rapid prototyping and iterative development of complex 3D mathematics and rendering optimizations.

## üì± FAQ

### How did you make the video for this site?
It's not a video! The terrain is being generated in realtime based on mathematical formulas. Every frame you see is calculated and rendered live in your browser using WebGL and Three.js.

### Does it work on mobile devices?
Yes! The terrain generator automatically adjusts the number of tiles and mesh resolution based on your device capabilities and screen size for optimal performance.
